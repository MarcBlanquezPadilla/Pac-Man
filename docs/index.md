##  Our Project
Weâ€™re going to replicate the 1980 Pac-Man game arcade version developed by Namco as a tribute to the game. This project has been done by two students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).

## About The Game
Pac-Man features a yellow, circular character named Pac-Man who runs through a maze eating balls while avoiding colorful ghosts. 
The goal is to clear each maze of balls and avoid the chasing ghosts.
