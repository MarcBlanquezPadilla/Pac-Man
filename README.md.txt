Short Description of the game:
Pac-Man features a yellow, circular character named Pac-Man who runs through a maze eating balls while avoiding colorful ghosts. 
The goal is to clear each maze of balls and avoid the chasing ghosts.

How to play the game?:
The goal is to eat all the balls while avoiding the four colorful ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) that roam the maze. Eating the larger balls temporarily allows Pac-Man to turn the tables, allowing him to chase and eat the ghosts for extra points. The game ends when Pac-Man loses all his lives by being caught by the ghosts.
To achieve this Pac-Man can move with the arrow keys to the right, left, up and down.
