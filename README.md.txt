Short Description of the game:
Pac-Man features a yellow, circular character named Pac-Man who runs through a maze eating pellets while avoiding colorful ghosts. 
The goal is to clear each maze of balls and avoid the chasing ghosts.

How to play the game?:
The goal is to eat all the pellets while avoiding the four colorful ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) that roam the maze. Eating the larger pellets temporarily allows Pac-Man to turn the tables, allowing him to chase and eat the ghosts for extra points. The game ends when Pac-Man loses all his lives by being caught by the ghosts.
To achieve this Pac-Man can move with the arrow keys to the right, left, up and down.

List of features:
Movement: Pac-Man can move up, down, left, or right within the maze.
Pellets: Pac-Man consumes small dots (pellets) scattered throughout the maze to earn points.
Power Pellets: There are larger pellets that grant Pac-Man the temporary ability to eat ghosts.
Ghosts: Pac-Man must avoid four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde), who patrol the maze and try to catch him.
Ghost Behavior: Each ghost has a unique behavior pattern that dictates its movement through the maze.
Chase Mode: Ghosts actively pursue Pac-Man.
Scatter Mode: Ghosts retreat to corners of the maze for a brief period.
Bonus Fruits: At certain stages, bonus items (fruits) appear, providing additional points when consumed.
Lives: Pac-Man has a limited number of lives, and each time a ghost catches him, he loses a life.
Score System: The game tracks points earned from pellets, power pellets, ghosts, and bonus fruits.
High Score: Players can aim to achieve a high score by maximizing points earned.
